# Meteorological Records

These notes document records are used for setting QC expected range
limits.  The records are (currently) taken from the Wikipedia page but
will be updated with full WMO references.  The page organizes records
by region.  I document records for all Arctic regions, and also
include Antarctic records.

## Near Surface Dewpoint Temperatures
### Minimum Temperature


### Maximum Temperature
Highest dew point temperature: A dew point of 35 °C (95 °F) — while
the temperature was 42 °C (108 °F) — was observed at Dhahran, Saudi
Arabia, at 3:00 p.m. on 8 July 2003

Highest temperature with 100% relative humidity: A temperature of 34
°C (93 °F) with 100% relative humidity in Jask, Iran, on 21 July
2012.  

## One-hour Precipitation Intensity
Most in 60 minutes (1 hour): 305 mm (12.0 in). Holt, Missouri, United
States, 22 June 1947


## Windspeed
Fastest non-tornadic winds: 408 km/h (254 mph) (3-second gust);
recorded by anemometer in Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia passing over
Barrow Island, Western Australia, 10 April 1996

Fastest non-cyclonic winds: 372 km/h (231 mph) (1-minute average);
recorded by anemometer on Mount Washington, New Hampshire, USA, 12
April 1934


## Surface Pressure

### Hurricane intensity
Most intense ever recorded: 870 hPa (25.69 inHg); eye of Super Typhoon
Tip over the northwest Pacific Ocean, 12 October 1979.  

Most intense in the Western Hemisphere: 872 hPa (25.75 inHg); eye of
Hurricane Patricia over the eastern Pacific Ocean, 23 October 2015.  

Most intense ever recorded on land: 892 hPa (26.35 inHg); Craig Key,
Florida, United States, eye of the Labor Day Hurricane, 2 September
1935. While other landfalling tropical cyclones potentially had lower
pressures, data is vague from areas other than the Atlantic basin,
especially before the invention of weather satellites.  

Most intense landfall (estimated): 884 hPa (26.10 inHg); Rakiraki
District, Viti Levu, Fiji, during Cyclone Winston, 20 February
2016. Although no official land pressure readings were recorded at the
landfall site, it is estimated the Winston made landfall with the
aforementioned pressure.

### Arctic Lows

The lowest central pressure recorded for an Arctic cyclone for te
satellire era (post 1979) is 966 hPa recorded on August 2
2012. https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL054259  


### Highest Pressures

The highest high pressures recorded occur in northern high latitudes
during winter when air is cold and dense.

The highest adjusted-to-sea-level barometric pressure ever recorded
(below 750 meters) was at Agata, Evenhiyskiy, Russia (66°53'N,
93°28'E, elevation: 261 m (856.3 ft)) on 31 December 1968 of 1,083.3
hectopascals (hPa) (31.99 inHg)
